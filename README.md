Data input
1) continuous flowcytometer data cruise 2013 : cell abundance, time/date, lat/lon
2) continuous measurements salinity, Temp, irradiance, chl fluorescence, time/date, lat/lon

Users:
-scientist

What questions need to be answered:
1) providing interactive visualisation tools for data exploration
2) effect of environmental parameters on cell abundance per population
3) diel variation - periodicity

1) two datasets: 1- biological (cell count) 2- environmental (temp salinty, etc), 3- geographical
2) data merging tool
3) grouping tool
4) plotting tool -graphical
5) plotting tool - geographical 

ipython notebook

Issues-
- do we need statistics?
- double check if time and lat/lon between two datafiles are compatible.
- diel analysis: moving through different area's, populations will change as well.

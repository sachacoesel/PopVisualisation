This tool will help users to explore phytoplankton population abundances over a transect in an interactive way. 

###Data input
Two datasets have been provided.

1. continuous flowcytometer data cruise 2013 : cell abundance, time/date, lat/lon
2. continuous measurements salinity, Temp, irradiance, chl fluorescence, time/date, lat/lon

The data consists of continuous flowcytometric measurements of photosynthetic pico-eukaryotes using the [SeaFlow](http://armbrustlab.ocean.washington.edu/resources/seaflow) cytometer data obtained during the 2013 deepDOM cruise covering a transect from Uruguay to the Amazon.
Users can also use their own cruise data, provided that the dataframe contains time/date data.

###Users and Uses
This interactive visualisation tool will allow scientists to explore the following questions:

1. effect of environmental parameters on cell abundance per population
2. diel variation - periodicity of cell abundance

### user cases
1. data merging tool
2. grouping tool
3. plotting tool -graphical
4. plotting tool - geographical 

###Organization of the project
The project has the following structure:
